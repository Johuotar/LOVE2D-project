# deeku

## requirements

- LÖVE 0.10.2
- balls

## how to run

You need have LÖVE binaries installed for your platform.

For Windows: just download from http://love2d.org

For Linux: Depending your distribution you might find a version from 
your distribution's package repositories. For example in Ubuntu you can 
do:

```sudo apt install love2d```

There might be generic binaries available for linux at http://love2d.org 
and other distributions.

Instructions for building can be found at 
http://love2d.org/wiki/Building_L%C3%96VE

TODO: Android

Once LÖVE binaries are installed open up your favorite (or forced to 
use) command interpreter, e.g. in Windows open up Powershell or cmd. Go 
to the directory that contains the game directory (deeku) or 
specifically, the parent directory of the deeku game-directory that 
contains the file main.lua. Then you can just run 'path/to/love 
deeku'. 

You can also add your love binary to your PATH environment variable if 
you are on windows, and usually on Ubuntu 'love' command already points 
to the binary if installed from package manager. Then you can just write 
'love deeku' from the games parent directory.
